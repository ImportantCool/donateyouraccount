  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>DonateYourAccount.com ("Donate Your Account") is a service hosted by its operators.</p>
  <p>The Ruby on Rails source code that literally shows how your data is being handled on DonateYourAccount.com is publicly available at <a href="http://github.com/kyleshank/donateyouraccount">http://github.com/kyleshank/donateyouraccount</a>.</p>
  <p>Your privacy is important.  Donate Your Account operates under these privacy principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
    <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    <li>We respect access to your Twitter and Facebook accounts and will enforce the terms of your account donations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
  <p>Like most website operators, Donate Your Account collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>
  <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p>Certain visitors to DonateYourAccount.com choose to interact with Donate Your Account in ways that require Donate Your Account to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Donate Your Account gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when you sign in and donate your Twitter or Facebook account to a Campaign. In each case, Donate Your Account collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Donate Your Account. Donate Your Account does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
  <h2>Third Party Accounts</h2>
  <p>Donate Your Account requires access to Third Party Accounts to provide service.  Third Party Accounts include Twitter and Facebook.</p>
  <p>Access to Third Party Accounts is established through authenticating the "Donate Your Account" application on the Third Party website.  Credentials to access Third Party Accounts are stored and refreshed upon expiration. Donate Your Account never has access to your Third Party Account password.</p>
  <p>Donate Your Account will read and store basic details about your Third Party Account profile after authentication to provide service.</p>
  <p>Donate Your Account will require the ability to publish to a Third Party Account on your behalf.  Donate Your Account will only publish to a Third Party Account when a donation is utilized. A donation can only be utilized by a Campaign under the donation frequency terms of 1 publish a day, 1 publish a week or 1 publish per month.</p>
  <p>Donate Your Account will not monitor your Third Party Account.</p>
  <p>You can formally block Donate Your Account from accessing a Third Party Account by revoking access to the "Donate Your Account" application on the Third Party Account website.</p>
  <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
  <p>Donate Your Account may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Donate Your Account may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Donate Your Account does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
  <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p>Donate Your Account discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its operators that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Donate Your Account's behalf or to provide services available at DonateYourAccount.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those operators may be located outside of your home country; by using DonateYourAccount.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Donate Your Account will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its operators, as described above, Donate Your Account discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Donate Your Account believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Donate Your Account, third parties or the public at large.
